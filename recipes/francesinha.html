    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Known as Little French or Frenchie, we have to be honest with you: the only thing little about Francesinha is the name.</p>
    <p>As with most food items in Porto, it is difficult to select just one as the best francesinha in the city. Each restaurant in Porto has its own recipe and most of them argue that the secret is in the sauce. Is it? Opinions diverge. Some argue that the secret of Francesinha is the quality of the products. In our opinion, both are correct. That being said, here’s how to make Francesinha like a local.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of loath</li>
        <li>1 linguiça</li>
        <li>1 salsicha</li>
        <li>1 fiambre</li>
        <li>1 steak</li>
        <li>5/6 Flamengo cheese slices</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slightly toast the bread – in the oven or in the toaster but without smooshing it, so it doesn’t lose its thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook the steak medium/rare and allow it to rest away from the heat for a few minutes, to retain the juices. Slit it slightly so that it’s easier to cut later on.</li>
        <li>Cut the linguiça and the Italian sausage length wise and trim them, if necessary, to match the size of the bread. Cook them in the same pan as the steak.</li>
        <li>Fry the egg(s) in the same pan again (optional). Fry the potatoes on the side (opcional).</li>
        <li>Assembling: after toasted, place one slice of bread in a deep dish that can go in the oven, and lay the slices of ham and baloney over the bread; place the sausage and the linguiça interspersed, side by side, and then the steak; place the second slice of bread on top and cover it all with cheese slices.</li>
        <li>Turn on the broil and place it in the oven until the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, (place the egg on top), pour at least two ladles of sauce over the francesinha and serve immediatly.</li>
        <li>Pour the rest of the sauce in a gravy boat and serve seperately (as well as the fries).</li>
    </ol>
